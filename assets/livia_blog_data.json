It may sound technical, but it’s actually quite straightforward. This article explains what TPAR is, who needs to lodge it, and how to do it with fewer surprises.\n\n\nOverview at a Glance\n\n\n• TPAR – Taxable Payments Annual Report: A yearly report to the ATO about payments you made to contractors in certain industries.\n\n• Who needs it? Businesses that pay contractors in specific service categories (e.g., construction, cleaning, IT, freight).\n\n• Deadline: 28 August for the last financial year that ended 30 June.\n\n• What to include: Contractor details, total amounts paid (incl. GST).\n\n\nWhat TPAR Means\n\n\nThe Taxable Payments Annual Report (TPAR) is a yearly report that some businesses have to submit to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). It shows how much you paid contractors for services during the financial year.\n\nThe ATO then cross-checks your reported payments with the contractors’ tax returns, helping to make sure everyone reports their income correctly - and keeping the tax system fair.\n\n\nWho Should Lodge a TPAR?\n\n\nYou may need to lodge a TPAR if your business:\n\n✔ Has an Australian Business Number (ABN), and\n✔ Pays contractors to provide certain services. Industries commonly required to lodge include:\n\n🏗 Building and construction\n 🧼 Cleaning services\n 🚚 Courier and road freight\n 💻 Information technology (IT)\n 🛡 Security, investigation, or surveillance\n\nIf your business provides both TPAR services and other unrelated services, work out what percentage of your income comes from the reportable services. If it’s 10% or more, you have lodge a TPAR; if it’s less than 10%, you generally don’t need to.\n\nNote: This 10% rule doesn’t apply to businesses providing building and construction services as these businesses usually need to report regardless of the percentage.\n\nFull list and examples are on the ATO website. Click here to learn more details.\n\n\nWhen Is the Deadline?\n\n\n28 August each year.\n\nFor example, for contractor payments made from 1 July 2025 to 30 June 2026, you have to lodge TPAR by 28 August 2026.\n\n\nWhat to Include in a TPAR\n\n\nPayer’s details, include:\n\n• Your details: Entity name, address and contact details\n\n• Your ABN (Australian Business Number)\n\nFor each contractor, include:\n\n• Personal details: Name, address and phone number\n\n• ABN (Australian Business Number)\n\n• Total amount you paid them, including GST\n\nYou can usually find this information on the invoices your contractors provide.\n\nSee a sample TPAR report here.\n\n\nWhat to Leave Out of a TPAR\n\n\n❌ Employee wages - money you pay your staff is reported through payroll, not TPAR.\n\n❌ Materials only - if you just bought supplies and didn’t pay for services, leave it out.\n\n❌ Incidental labour - small, one-off helper or demo work that isn’t part of the main service.\n\n❌ Unpaid invoices after 30 June – only include payments you actually made on or before 30 June.\n\n❌ Labour-hire workers - if a labour-hire firm provides the worker, the payment is reported by the firm, not you.\n\n❌ Payments to foreign residents for work in Australia – most of these are reported through PAYG foreign resident withholding. Only include them in TPAR if they aren’t covered by PAYG.\n\n❌ Contractors without an ABN - usually not reported in TPAR. If you withheld tax because they didn’t provide an ABN, report it using the PAYG payment summary – withholding where ABN not quoted instead.\n\n❌ Private or domestic projects - work done for personal projects (not your business) should not be included.\n\n\nPractical tips to make TPAR easier\n\n\n📌 Keep good records all year\n\nUpload each contractor’s invoice to the corresponding payment transaction in the ANNA app or ANNA Business Dashboard. Categorise the payment as “sub-contractor” and add any notes you need - don’t wait until June 30!\n💡 If your business is registered for GST, make sure your GST settings are saved in the ANNA Business Dashboard so GST components on payments are recorded correctly.\n\n💡You need to keep these records for at least 5 years starting from when you prepared or obtained the records or completed the transactions or acts those records relate to, whichever is later.\n\n📌 Check ABNs before you pay\n\nIt’s much easier to confirm contractor details up front than correct them at the end of the year. You can check their ABN details via ABN lookup.\n\n📌 Use the ATO TPAR worksheet\n\nThe ATO provides a TPAR worksheet to help you calculate and organise payments for each contractor. Use this guide to make sure nothing is missed.\n\n<<<< Back to ANNA +Taxes", "content_text_zh": "如果您在某些行业工作并付费给承包商来帮助您经营业务，您可能需要填写一份年度报告 - 应税付款年度报告 (TPAR)（如果您有兴趣，发音为 tee-par）。这听起来可能很技术性，但实际上非常简单。本指南将引导您了解什么是 TPAR、谁需要提交以及如何轻松提交。\n\n\n快速总结\n\n\n• TPAR – 应税付款年度报告：向ATO 提交的关于您向某些行业承包商支付的付款的年度报告。\n\n• 谁需要它？向特定服务类别（例如建筑、清洁、IT、货运）承包商付款的企业。\n\n• 截止日期：截至6 月30 日的上一财政年度的8 月28 日。\n\n• 包含内容：承包商详细信息、支付的总金额（包括消费税）。\n\n\n什么是TPAR？\n\n\n应税付款年度报告 (TPAR) 是一些企业必须向澳大利亚税务局 (ATO) 提交的年度报告。它显示您在本财政年度向承包商支付的服务费用。\n\n然后，ATO 会交叉检查您报告的付款与承包商的纳税申报表，帮助确保每个人正确报告其收入 - 并保持税收制度的公平。\n\n\n谁需要提交 TPAR？\n\n\n如果您的企业符合以下条件，您可能需要提交 TPAR：\n\n✔ 拥有澳大利亚商业号码 (ABN)，并且\n✔ 向承包商支付费用以提供某些服务。通常需要提交申请的行业包括：\n\n🏗 建筑与施工\n 🧼 清洁服务\n 🚚 快递和公路货运\n 💻信息技术（IT）\n 🛡 安全、调查或监视\n\n如果您的企业同时提供 TPAR 服务和其他不相关服务，请计算出您的收入中来自应报告服务的百分比。如果是 10% 或以上，则您已提交 TPAR；如果低于10%，一般不需要。\n\n注意：此 10% 规则不适用于提供建筑服务的企业，因为这些企业通常需要报告，无论百分比如何。\n\n完整列表和示例位于 ATO 网站上。单击此处了解更多详细信息。\n\n\n什么时候到期？\n\n\n每年8月28日。\n\n例如，对于2025年7月1日至2026年6月30日期间支付的承包商付款，您必须在2026年8月28日之前提交TPAR。\n\n\nTPAR 里有什么？\n\n\n付款人的详细信息，包括：\n\n• 您的详细信息：实体名称、地址和联系方式\n\n• 您的 ABN（澳大利亚商业号码）\n\n对于每个承包商，包括：\n\n• 个人详细信息：姓名、地址和电话号码\n\n• ABN（澳大利亚商业号码）\n\n• 您支付给他们的总金额，包括商品及服务税\n\n您通常可以在承包商提供的发票上找到此信息。\n\n请参阅此处的示例 TPAR 报告。\n\n\nTPAR 中不包含哪些内容？\n\n\n❌ 员工工资 - 您支付给员工的钱通过工资单报告，而不是 TPAR。\n\n❌ 仅材料 - 如果您只是购买了用品并且没有支付服务费用，请将其保留。\n\n❌ 附带劳动 - 不属于主要服务一部分的小型一次性帮助或演示工作。\n\n❌ 6 月 30 日之后未付的发票 – 仅包括您在 6 月 30 日或之前实际支付的款项。\n\n❌ 劳务雇佣工人 - 如果劳务雇佣公司提供工人，则付款由该公司而不是您报告。\n\n❌ 支付给外国居民在澳大利亚工作的费用——其中大部分是通过现收现付外国居民预扣税来报告的。仅当 PAYG 未涵盖时才将其包含在 TPAR 中。\n\n❌ 没有 ABN 的承包商 - 通常不会在 TPAR 中报告。如果您因为他们没有提供 ABN 而预扣税款，请使用现收现付付款摘要进行报告 - 在未引用 ABN 的情况下进行预扣税。\n\n❌ 私人或国内项目 - 不应该包括为个人项目（不是您的企业）所做的工作。\n\n\nANNA 减轻 TPAR 痛苦的秘诀\n\n\n📌全年保持良好记录\n\n将每个承包商的发票上传到 ANNA 应用程序或 ANNA 业务仪表板中相应的付款交易。将付款分类为“分包商”并添加您需要的任何注释 - 不要等到 6 月 30 日！\n💡 如果您的企业注册了 GST，请确保您的 GST 设置保存在 ANNA 业务仪表板中，以便正确记录付款中的 GST 组成部分。\n\n💡您需要将这些记录保存至少5年，从您准备或获取记录或完成与这些记录相关的交易或行为时算起，以较晚者为准。\n\n📌 付款前检查 ABN\n\n提前确认承包商的详细信息比在年底纠正它们要容易得多。您可以通过 ABN 查找来查看他们的 ABN 详细信息。\n\n📌 使用 ATO TPAR 工作表\n\nATO 提供 TPAR 工作表来帮助您计算和组织每个承包商的付款。使用本指南可确保不会遗漏任何内容。\n\n<<<< 返回安娜 +税"}, {"title": "PAYG Instalments: A Practical Guide for Small Business", "title_zh": "现收现付分期付款解释", "date": "2026-02-10", "readTime": 5, "author": "Livia Lin", "source": "https://annamoney.au/blog/guides/payg-instalment/", "excerpt": "If you run a small businesses, work as a sole trader, or operate through a company, you might receive a letter from the ATO asking you to pay PAYG instalments.

They’re designed to help you avoid a much larger tax bill later by spreading your payments across the year instead of paying everything at once. In this guide, we’ll break down what PAYG instalments are, why they happen, and how to stay in control of your finances.\n\n\nOverview at a Glance\n\n\n• PAYG instalments are advance payments on your income tax\n\n• Paying them is a legal obligation once the ATO issues an instalment notice\n\n• What you pay is credited toward your final tax outcome\n\n• The ATO usually enrols you automatically once your income reaches certain levels\n\n• You can adjust the amount, but underpaying may lead to interest or penalties\n\nExtra help: use ATO’s PAYG instalment calculator to estimate your instalment amount.\n\n\nWhat are PAYG instalments?\n\n\nPAYG (Pay As You Go) instalments are regular payments you make during the year toward your expected income tax. Instead of paying one large tax bill at the end of the year, instalments spread the cost across the year, helping you manage cash flow.\n\nNot every business has to pay PAYG instalments. The ATO usually places you in the system automatically if your income or last year’s tax payable meets certain thresholds.\n\nOnce the ATO issues an instalment notice, paying the amount by the due date is a legal requirement.\n\nEven if you pay instalments, you still must lodge an annual tax return. Any instalments you’ve paid are credited toward your total tax, so you either pay the remaining balance or receive a refund.\n\n\nWhen the ATO adds you to PAYG instalments\n\n\nAfter you lodge your tax return, the ATO reviews the information you’ve reported to determine whether you should start paying PAYG instalments. One of the main things they consider is your instalment income, essentially your gross business and investment income. You can find the full list of what counts as instalment income on the ATO website.\n\nFor individuals or sole traders:\n\nYou will automatically enter the PAYG instalments system if you have all of the following:\n\n• Instalment income from your latest tax return of $4,000 or more\n\n• Tax payable on your latest notice of assessment of $1,000 or more\n\n• Estimated (notional) tax of $500 or more\n\nFor companies:\n\nYou’ll automatically enter the PAYG instalments system if any of the following apply:\n\n• Instalment income from latest tax return of $2 million or more\n\n• Estimated (notional) tax of $500 or more\n\n• The company is the head of a consolidated group\n\nWhen you’re entered into the system, the ATO will notify you – usually through your myGov inbox, Online Services for business (i.e. ATO business portal), or by letter – and tell you how often to pay and how to calculate your instalments.\n\nWant to see a sample of PAYG instalment notice? Click here.\n\n\nHow often do you pay?\n\n\nMost small businesses pay quarterly, but some eligible taxpayers can pay twice a year or annually, while very large businesses (with income over $20 million) usually pay monthly.\n\nStandard due dates for quarterly payers:\n\nSep Quarter - 1 July to 30 September: Due date: 28 October\n\nDec Quarter - 1 October to 31 December: Due date: 28 February\n\nMar Quarter - 1 January to 31 March: Due date: 28 April\n\nJun Quarter - 1 April to 30 June: Due date: 28 July\n\nMake sure you pay all your instalments before you lodge your tax return. The instalments you pay throughout the year will then be taken into account in your tax assessment.\n\nIf you are already paying a quarterly BAS, your PAYG instalment will be added to your GST and other liabilities on the same activity statement, so you may pay everything in one go by the due date.\n\nWant to know more about PAYG instalment payment cycles? Check out the ATO website.\n\n\nHow much do you should pay?\n\n\nWhen it comes to PAYG instalment payments, you generally have two options:\n\nOption 1 – use the ATO’s calculated amount\nThe ATO estimates your instalment based on your latest tax return, so you don’t need to do any calculations.\n\nOption 2 – calculate using your instalment rate\nThe ATO provides an instalment rate (a percentage) that you multiply by your business income for the period. This method is useful if your income fluctuates during the year, as your instalments will rise and fall with your earnings.\n\nIf you’re eligible to choose between these options, both will be shown on your activity statement or instalment notice. Choose your preferred option when you lodge, and you’ll continue using that option for the rest of the financial year. If you want to change options, you may do so on your first activity statement of the next financial year.\n\nImportant: no matter which option you choose, it does not change your final tax liability. It simply spreads your tax payments throughout the year, helping you manage cash flow and avoid a large lump-sum bill.\n\n\nCan you change the amount?\n\n\nYes, you may vary your PAYG instalment if you expect your income to be higher or lower than the ATO originally estimated. This helps keep your tax payments aligned with your real cash flow.\n\nBut timing matters – you must make the variation on your activity statement or instalment notice before the due date for that instalment and before lodging your annual tax return for that year. After the due date passes, you generally can’t adjust that period – you’ll need to wait until the next one.\n\nBe careful when reducing payments. If your varied instalments end up being 15% or more below your actual tax liability, the ATO may charge interest on the shortfall.\n\nMore information about varying your PAYG instalments can be found on the ATO website.\n\n\nPAYGI vs PAYGW: a common mix-up\n\n\nThe names are similar, so it’s easy to confuse them but they apply to very different things:\n\nPAYG instalments (PAYGI): these are advance payments towards your own income tax, helping you spread the cost across the year instead of paying a large amount at tax time.\n\nPAYG withholding (PAYGW): this is tax you withhold from payments such as employee wages and remit to the ATO on their behalf.\n\n\nTips for managing PAYG instalments\n\n\nKeep an eye on your profits: if your income changes during the year, review your instalments and vary them if needed so you’re not over- or under-paying.\n\nRead ATO notices carefully: PAYG instalments are a legal requirement. Your activity statement or instalment notice tells you how much to pay and when it’s due.\n\nPlan for cash flow: treat PAYG as part of your regular expenses. Setting funds aside as you earn can help you avoid surprises and stay in control of your finances.\n\n\nHow ANNA Money can help\n\n\nANNA Money is a business account designed to make financial admin simpler, especially for small businesses and sole traders.\n\nWith smart pots, you may set money aside specifically for tax obligations like PAYG instalments and GST, so funds are always ready when payments are due – instead of getting mixed up with everyday spending. You can even set a percentage of your income to automatically transfer into your tax pot, helping you stay on top of cash flow and avoid last‑minute panic.\n\nANNA also provides a business summary (coming soon) and real-time tracking of your financial position, giving you a clear view of your income and expenses in one place. This makes it easier to estimate your PAYG instalments and plan your cash flow throughout the year.\n\n<<<< Back to ANNA +Taxes", "content_text_zh": "如果您经营小型企业、个体经营者或通过公司经营，您可能会收到 ATO 的一封信，要求您支付 PAYG 分期付款。当这封信到达时，许多企业主都措手不及。您可能会想：“为什么我突然欠ATO钱了？”\n“我做错什么了吗？”\n“我该如何支付这笔费用？”如果您没有做好准备，这笔意外的应付款项可能会导致您的现金流紧张。好消息？现收现付分期付款并不是一种惩罚——它们通常是您的业务正在增长的标志。它们旨在通过分摊全年付款而不是一次支付所有费用来帮助您避免以后缴纳更多税款。在本指南中，我们将详细介绍什么是现收现付分期付款、分期付款的原因以及如何控制您的财务状况。\n\n\n快速总结\n\n\n• PAYG 分期付款是您所得税的预付款\n\n• 一旦 ATO 发出分期付款通知，付款即成为法律义务\n\n• 您所支付的金额将计入您的最终税务结果\n\n• 一旦您的收入达到一定水平，ATO 通常会自动为您登记\n\n• 您可以调整金额，但支付不足可能会导致利息或罚款\n\n额外帮助：使用 ATO 的 PAYG 分期付款计算器来估算您的分期付款金额。\n\n\n什么是 PAYG 分期付款？\n\n\nPAYG（现收现付）分期付款是您在一年中定期支付的预期所得税。分期付款无需在年底支付一大笔税款，而是可以将成本分摊到全年，帮助您管理现金流。\n\n并非每个企业都必须按现收现付分期付款。如果您的收入或去年的应缴税款达到特定阈值，ATO 通常会自动将您纳入系统。\n\n一旦 AT​​O 发出分期付款通知，法律要求在到期日之前支付金额。\n\n即使您分期付款，您仍然必须提交年度纳税申报表。您支付的所有分期付款都会记入您的总税款中，因此您要么支付剩余余额，要么获得退款。\n\n\n当 ATO 将您添加到 PAYG 分期付款中时\n\n\n在您提交纳税申报表后，ATO 会审核您报告的信息，以确定您是否需要开始支付现收现付分期付款。他们考虑的主要因素之一是您的分期付款收入，本质上是您的总业务和投资收入。您可以在 ATO 网站上找到分期付款收入的完整列表。\n\n对于个人或个体经营者：\n\n如果您具备以下全部条件，您将自动进入PAYG分期付款系统：\n\n• 您最新纳税申报表中的分期收入达到或超过 4,000 美元\n\n• 您最新评估通知上的应缴税款为 1,000 美元或以上\n\n• 预计（名义）税额为 500 美元或以上\n\n对于公司：\n\n如果满足以下任一条件，您将自动进入 PAYG 分期付款系统：\n\n• 最新纳税申报表的分期收入达到或超过 200 万美元\n\n• 预计（名义）税额为 500 美元或以上\n\n• 该公司是合并集团的领导者\n\n当您进入系统时，ATO 通常会通过您的 myGov 收件箱、企业在线服务（即 ATO 业务门户）或信件通知您，并告诉您付款的频率以及如何计算分期付款。\n\n想查看 PAYG 分期付款通知样本吗？点击这里。\n\n\n您多久付款一次？\n\n\n大多数小型企业按季度缴纳，但一些符合条件的纳税人可以每年缴纳两次或每年缴纳，而大型企业（收入超过 2000 万美元）通常每月缴纳。\n\n季度付款人的标准到期日：\n\n九月季度 - 7月1日至9月30日：截止日期：10月28日\n\n12 月季度 - 10 月 1 日至 12 月 31 日：截止日期：2 月 28 日\n\n三月季度 - 1月1日至3月31日：截止日期：4月28日\n\n六月季度 - 4月1日至6月30日：截止日期：7月28日\n\n确保在提交纳税申报表之前支付所有分期付款。您全年支付的分期付款将计入您的纳税评估中。\n\n如果您已经按季度缴纳 BAS，则您的现收现付分期付款将添加到同一活动报表上的 GST 和其他负债中，这样您就可以在到期日之前一次性支付所有费用。\n\n想了解更多关于PAYG分期付款周期的信息吗？查看 ATO 网站。\n\n\n您需要支付多少钱？\n\n\n当谈到PAYG分期付款时，您通常有两种选择：\n\n选项 1 – 使用 ATO 的计算金额\nATO 根据您最新的纳税申报表估算您的分期付款，因此您无需进行任何计算。\n\n选项 2 – 使用分期付款利率计算\nATO 提供分期付款利率（百分比），您可以将其乘以该期间的营业收入。如果您的收入在一年中波动，此方法很有用，因为您的分期付款会随着您的收入而上升和下降。\n\n如果您有资格在这些选项之间进行选择，则这两个选项都会显示在您的活动报表或分期付款通知中。提交时选择您的首选选项，您将在本财政年度的剩余时间内继续使用该选项。如果您想更改选项，您可以在下一个财政年度的第一份活动报表中进行操作。\n\n重要提示：无论您选择哪个选项，都不会改变您的最终纳税义务。它只是将您的税款分摊到全年，帮助您管理现金流并避免巨额一次性账单。\n\n\n可以更改金额吗？\n\n\n是的，如果您预计您的收入高于或低于 ATO 最初估计的收入，您可以更改您的 PAYG 分期付款。这有助于使您的纳税额与您的实际现金流保持一致。\n\n但时间很重要——您必须在分期付款到期日之前以及提交当年的年度纳税申报表之前对您的活动报表或分期付款通知进行更改。到期日过后，您通常无法调整该期限 - 您需要等到下一个期限。\n\n减少付款时要小心。如果您的不同分期付款最终比您的实际纳税义务低 15% 或更多，ATO 可能会对差额收取利息。\n\n有关改变 PAYG 分期付款的更多信息可以在 ATO 网站上找到。\n\n\nPAYGI 与 PAYGW：常见的混淆\n\n\n名称相似，因此很容易混淆，但它们适用于非常不同的事物：\n\n现收现付分期付款 (PAYGI)：这些是您自己所得税的预付款，可帮助您分摊全年费用，而不是在纳税时支付大笔金额。\n\n现收现付预扣税 (PAYGW)：这是您从员工工资等付款中预扣的税款，并代表他们汇给 ATO。\n\n\n管理现收现付分期付款的提示\n\n\n密切关注您的利润：如果您的收入在一年中发生变化，请检查您的分期付款并根据需要进行调整，以免您支付过多或过少。\n\n请仔细阅读 ATO 通知：现收现付分期付款是法律要求。您的活动报表或分期付款通知会告诉您需要支付多少金额以及到期时间。\n\n现金流计划：将现收现付视为常规开支的一部分。在赚取收入时留出资金可以帮助您避免意外并保持对财务的控制。\n\n\nANNA Money 如何提供帮助\n\n\nANNA Money 是一个企业帐户，旨在简化财务管理，特别是对于小型企业和个体经营者。\n\n借助智能罐，您可以专门留出资金用于支付现收现付分期付款和商品及服务税等纳税义务，因此在付款到期时资金始终准备就绪，而不是与日常支出混在一起。您甚至可以设置收入的一定百分比，自动转入您的税金池，帮助您掌控现金流并避免最后一刻的恐慌。\n\nANNA还提供业务摘要（即将推出）和实时跟踪您的财务状况，让您在一处清晰了解您的收入和支出。这使得您可以更轻松地估算您的现收现付分期付款并规划您全年的现金流。\n\n<<<< 返回安娜 +税"}, {"title": "PSI Rules in Australia: A Real-World Walkthrough for Contractors", "title_zh": "驾驭澳大利亚 PSI（个人服务收入）规则 — 用户体验设计师 Beatrice 的故事", "date": "2025-12-05", "readTime": 15, "author": "Livia Lin", "source": "https://annamoney.au/blog/guides/blogpersonal-services-income-psi-australia-beatrice-story/", "excerpt": "If most of your freelance or contracting income comes from your own effort, the ATO may classify it as PSI.

Beatrice’s journey as a UX designer shows how PSI works in real life and when the PSB tests can help you avoid PSI restrictions.\n\nEver wondered if your freelance gigs, design work, or side hustle might be caught under the ATO’s Personal Services Income (PSI) rules? You’re not alone.\n\nIn Australia, if most of your income comes from your personal skills and effort, the ATO may classify it as PSI - not to trap you, but to make sure there’s fair tax treatment (especially when people use companies or trusts mainly to lower their tax).\n\nLet’s make this easy - and fun (well, more fun than it should be!) - to understand.\n\nWe’ll walk through a real-world story of Beatrice, a User Experience (UX) designer who starts as a sole trader, quickly expands her client base, and eventually operates a full design business through a company. Along the way, we’ll see how her income gets defined as PSI, and how the PSB tests (Results, the 80% rule, Unrelated Clients, Employment, and Business Premises) apply at every stage.\n\n\nOverview at a Glance:\n\n\nWhat is PSI?\nIncome mainly from your own skills, effort, or expertise (over 50% of the value).\n\nWho it affects:\nFreelancers, contractors, consultants, creatives, specialists – anyone paid for their personal effort.\n\nPurpose of the PSI rules:\nTo stop income-splitting through structures like companies or trusts and to limit the deductions for employee-like contracting workers.\n\nBusiness structure doesn’t matter:\nPSI rules apply whether you’re a sole trader or have a company, trust, or partnership – the income’s still attributed to you.\n\nHow to avoid PSI restrictions: \nIf you pass any of the Personal Services Business (PSB) tests (these are called: Results, the 80% rule, Unrelated Clients, Employment, and Business Premises), the PSI rules probably won’t apply to you.\n\n\nUnderstanding PSI and PSB — before we dive into Beatrice’s story\n\n\nBefore we get into Beatrice’s journey, let’s quickly look at two key ATO concepts: Personal Services Income (PSI) and Personal Services Business (PSB).\n\nPersonal Services Income (PSI) is income that’s mainly a reward for your own personal skills or effort. It’s common for freelancers, consultants, specialists and creatives - think designers, engineers, consultants, and contractors who get paid for the work they personally do. The PSI rules don’t affect you if you're an employee receiving only salary or wages.\n\nIf you earn PSI, special tax rules apply to prevent you from “splitting” that income through a company, trust, or partnership to reduce tax. In other words, the ATO will generally attribute that income back to you, the person who did the work, and the deductions you may claim against this income are limited too.\n\nHowever, you may qualify as a Personal Services Business (PSB) if you meet certain tests. If you do, the PSI rules won’t apply, and you may treat your income more like business income.\n\nHere are the four PSB tests the ATO uses:\n\nResults test - To pass this test, you should meet all 3 of the following conditions for at least 75% of your PSI you earned:\n\n• You’re paid to produce a result.\n\n• You use your own tools/equipment, and\n\n• You’re responsible for fixing mistakes.\n\nUnrelated clients test - You get income from two or more unrelated clients (and their associates).\n\nEmployment test - You hire others (employees or contractors) to do at least 20% of the principal work.\n\nBusiness premises test - You keep business premises that are separate from your home and clients’ premises.\n\nYou can self-assess as a Personal Services Business (PSB) if either:\n\n• You pass the Results test for most of your PSI (at least 75%), or\n\n• You pass one of the other PSB tests and no single client (or their related associates) provides more than 80% of your PSI.\n\nIf you may’t self-assess as a PSB, you may be able to apply for a PSB determination (PSBD) from the ATO.\n\n\nWhat to Do If the PSI Rules Don’t Apply\n\n\nEven if the PSI rules don’t apply to your income, you still need to declare all your Personal Services Income (PSI) on your tax return. This means reporting your earnings just like any other business or personal income. When the rules don’t apply, you may generally claim the full range of deductions that relate to earning the income, without the limitations that usually apply under the PSI rules.\n\n\nWhat to Do If the PSI Rules Do Apply\n\n\nIf the PSI rules apply to you, you’ve got to follow steps to comply with the ATO’s requirements. First, attribute the PSI to the person who performed the work - that’s usually you - even if the income was paid to a company, trust, or partnership. Next, calculate your net PSI by deducting only the expenses allowed under the PSI rules, which are generally limited to those an employee could claim.\n\nYou may also have additional PAYG withholding or instalment obligations if the PSI received by your business wasn’t promptly paid as salary or wages to the person doing the work. “Promptly paid” means paying the amount by the 14th day after the relevant PAYG payment period in which the PSI was received.\n\nNavigating the PSI rules can feel very tricky, but the ATO’s got plenty of detailed guidance if you need it.\n\nNext, we follow Beatrice’s story to see how the rules play out in real life - and what it means for her taxes along the way.\n\n\nBeatrice’s Journey: UX Designer Turned Business Owner\n\n\n\nStage 1: From Employee to Sole Trader (2023)\n\n\nBeatrice used to work as a UX designer for a software company X Pty Ltd, creating user workflows and interfaces. She wanted more control over her projects, so she became a sole trader, contracting back to the same company. She provides design services exclusively for X Pty Ltd, working in her home office (a spare bedroom) and using a combination of her own laptop and the company’s software subscriptions. Beatrice’s paid hourly, has to fix errors when requested, and adjusts her designs according to the company’s feedback.\n\n\nPSI and PSB Considerations\n\n\nResults test – Beatrice fails ❌\nTo pass the Results test, three conditions have to be met:\n\n• Paid to produce a specific result.\n\n• Required to provide her own equipment or tools.\n\n• Liable to fix mistakes at her own cost.\n\nBeatrice doesn’t meet the first two conditions: she’s paid by the hour, not for a specific deliverable, and she relies on X Pty Ltd’s software subscriptions rather than fully supplying her own tools. While she fixes mistakes and uses her laptop, her liability’s limited, as she isn’t responsible for the cost of software subscriptions or other business overheads.\n\nThat means Beatrice can’t self-assess as a Personal Services Business (PSB) under the Results test.\n\nAdditionally, since all of her PSI comes from a single client (X Pty Ltd), she can’t rely on the other PSB tests (Unrelated Clients, Employment, Business Premises) to qualify. She’ll need to report this income on her personal tax return as PSI income, and only limited deductions - directly related to earning the PSI - are allowed.\n\nOther considerations: She needs to register for GST if turnover hits $75,000.\n\n\nStage 2: Growing Clients and Setting Up a Company (2024)\n\n\nBeatrice’s freelance work is picking up. She’s recently secured a second client, Y Pty Ltd, referred by X Pty Ltd. Both businesses engage her for UX design services. She still works hourly from her home office using her own laptop, although she still relies on her clients’ software subscriptions to complete design tasks.\n\nEncouraged by her growing workload - and hearing that “setting up a company can save tax” — Beatrice registers Beatrice Designs Pty Ltd. She plans to pay herself a salary and bring her partner, Henry, on board to help with administration, handling invoicing, emails, and client calls while she focuses on design work.\n\nOver the year, the company earns (GST excl.):\n\n• $100,000 from X Pty Ltd (59% of total income)\n\n• $70,000 from Y Pty Ltd (41% of total income)\n\nTotal Income: $170,000\n\nBeatrice paid herself $50,000 in wages to cover living expenses and reported $6,800 in PAYGW (tax withheld on wages) via the company's quarterly BAS (Business Activity Statement). No other business expenses have occurred. At the end of the financial year, she plans to pay Henry wages to make use of his tax-free threshold and reduce their overall tax position. Before going ahead, she consults an accountant - only to be shocked by the impact of PSI rules.\n\n\nPSI and PSB Considerations\n\n\nResults test – Beatrice fails ❌\nBeatrice’s still paid by the hour rather than for a specific result. She uses her own laptop, but she relies on client subscriptions for design tools and isn’t fully responsible for business overheads. Therefore, she fails the Results test.\n\n80% rule – Beatrice passes ✅\nWith multiple clients and no single client providing more than 80% of her PSI, she can consider other PSB tests (Unrelated Clients, Employment, and Business Premises) to see if she can qualify as a Personal Services Business (PSB) to avoid PSI rules.\n\nUnrelated clients test - Beatrice fails ❌\nTo pass this test, Beatrice must:\n\n• Receive PSI from two or more unrelated clients, and\n\n• Be engaged as a direct result of offering her services to the public.\n\nAlthough Beatrice now works for two unrelated clients, both came through a referral - not from a public advertisement or tender. According to the ATO, “word-of-mouth referrals alone do not meet this test” unless you’re in a highly specialised niche industry. Because of this, her income’s likely to fail this test.\n\nEmployment test – Beatrice fails ❌\nYour business must employ or contract others to do at least 20% of the principal work that generates your PSI. Henry’s work is administrative, not work that generates PSI.\n\nBusiness premises test – Beatrice fails ❌\nBeatrice continues to work from her home office, not separate business premises.\n\n\nTax implications\n\n\nBeatrice has failed to establish her business as a PSB. This means the net PSI earned through Beatrice Designs Pty Ltd will still be attributed back to her personally. Deductions are limited under PSI rules, and the salary and super she plans to pay Henry can’t be claimed.\n\nHere’s how this works in practice: Beatrice calculates her net PSI: $170,000 income minus $50,000 salary = $120,000 net PSI.\nShe has to lodge both a personal income tax return and a company tax return.\n\nIn her Personal Tax Return, Beatrice reports:\n\n• Salary: $50,000 with $6,800 tax withheld under ‘Salary or wages’\n\n• Attributed PSI: $120,000 under ‘Attributed Personal Services Income’\n\n• Additional PAYGW obligations on $120,000 (explained below)\n\nA note on deduction limitation:\nBeatrice can’t claim deductions for:\n\n• Any salaries or super she plans to pay Henry can’t be deducted under PSI rules, because his work is administrative, not principal work generating PSI. That means it doesn’t reduce the attributed PSI or PAYGW obligations. Even if Beatrice pays Henry, these payments can’t reduce her PSI or PAYG obligations. Henry’s salary won’t be included in his assessable income, and any PAYG withholding Beatrice pays for him can be credited to her on her personal return to avoid double taxation.\n\n• Home office occupancy costs such as rent, mortgage interest, rates, and land tax, to the extent they relate to her home office.\n\n\nHow Beatrice Designs Pty Ltd Reports PSI\n\n\nThe company reports the $120,000 of attributed PSI as a reconciliation item under “Other income not included in assessable income”. This excludes it from the company’s assessable income, and the PSI section’s completed accordingly. This makes sure it complies with PSI rules while avoiding double taxation.\n\n\nInteraction with Superannuation Guarantee (SG)\n\n\nAccording to ATO ID 2015/9, when a company earns PSI and the income’s merely attributed to the worker (not actually paid as wages), SG obligations don’t generally arise. SG only applies when the worker actually receives wages or salary.\n\nIn Beatrice’s case:\n\n• She paid herself $50,000 in wages during the year. Because these are actual payments, SG obligations apply in this case. Beatrice Designs Pty Ltd needs to calculate and pay SG contributions for her.\n\nThe superannuation contributions are generally deductible and can reduce net PSI, provided the payments are made on time and meet the requirements under the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.\n\nIf Beatrice hadn’t paid herself any wages and simply attributed the $170,000 back at year-end, no SG would be triggered, because no actual payment was made for principal work.\n\n\nPAYGW Obligations\n\n\nWhen your business earns Personal Services Income (PSI) and the PSI rules apply, the income has to be declared by the person who actually did the work - in Beatrice’s case, that’s her. This affects how PAYG withholding (PAYGW) works, depending on whether the income’s actually paid as salary or remains as “attributed PSI.”\n\nA. Salary Paid Promptly (under 14 days after PAYG period)\nBeatrice’s $50,000 salary was paid promptly, triggering normal PAYGW obligations. Her company correctly reported $6,800 via STP/BAS.\n\nB. Attributed PSI (Not Paid Promptly)\nThe remaining $120,000 is treated as attributed PSI. Even though Beatrice didn’t receive it as wages, the company still needs to:\n\n• Calculate additional PAYGW on this $120,000 based on her marginal tax rate\n\n• Report and pay the additional PAYGW through amended BAS for each quarter\n\n• Provide Beatrice with an annual PAYG payment summary/income statement showing both salary with normal tax withheld and additional PAYGW\n\n• Submit an annual report to the ATO at year-end, showing additional PAYG withholding at the end of the income year\n\n\nStage 3: Expanding Through Advertising (2025)\n\n\nBeatrice continues to grow her business and consults an accountant about PSI rules. She places ads on LinkedIn and Facebook and creates a website showcasing her work. She gets two new clients, Z Pty Ltd and A Pty Ltd. She’s still paid hourly for her UX design services and now fully relies on her own laptop, software subscriptions, and design tools.\n\nTo maintain efficient operations, Beatrice Designs Pty Ltd continues running smoothly. Henry supports administrative tasks, including invoicing, emails, and client calls.\n\nFinancial Year Overview:\n\nIncome (excl. GST):\n\n• $100,000 from X Pty Ltd (46% of PSI)\n\n• $70,000 from Y Pty Ltd (32% of PSI)\n\n• $25,000 from Z Pty Ltd (11% of PSI)\n\n• $25,000 from A Pty Ltd (11% of PSI)\n\nTotal Income: $220,000\n\nExpenses (excl. GST):\n\n• $45,000 salary to Beatrice (+$5,400 super)\n\n• $45,000 salary to Henry (+$5,400 super)\n\n• $2,000 accounting fees\n\n• $1,000 software subscriptions\n\n• $329 ASIC fee\n\nTotal Expense: $104,129\n\n\nPSI and PSB Considerations:\n\n\nResults test – Beatrice fails ❌\n\nBeatrice’s still paid hourly, not for a specific outcome.\n\n80% rule - Beatrice passes ✅\nWith plenty of clients and no single client providing more than 80% of her PSI, she passes the 80% rule and can consider other PSB tests.\n\nUnrelated clients test - Beatrice passes ✅\nBeatrice gained Z Pty Ltd and A Pty Ltd through public advertising, satisfying the “offer to the public” requirement. Also, clients X, Y, Z and A are unrelated and not associated with each other, meaning the unrelated clients test is met.\n\nEmployment test - Beatrice fails ❌ \nBeatrice does all principal work herself; Henry only handles administrative tasks.\n\nBusiness premises test - Beatrice fails ❌ \nBeatrice works from home without separate business premises.\n\n\nTax Implications\n\n\nBeatrice’s PSI now passes both the 80% rule and the unrelated clients test, which means she can self-assess as a Personal Services Business (PSB). As a result, the PSI rules no longer apply to her income.\n\nThis has several practical effects:\n\n• Income Reporting: The income remains assessable at the company level and has to be reported under the relevant label in the company tax return. The resulting net profit is then taxed at the company tax rate of 25%.\n\n• Deductions: Beatrice can claim a broader range of business expenses, including software subscriptions, ASIC fees, accounting fees, salaries and super to herself and Henry, and home-based business expenses (both running costs and occupancy costs). She’s no longer restricted by PSI-specific deduction limits.\n\n• Payroll Compliance: Beatrice Designs Pty Ltd must register for PAYG withholding (PAYGW) and report wages and PAYGW through its BAS. Pay runs should be completed using STP-enabled payroll software. The Superannuation Guarantee (SG) obligation’s also triggered, and the company must pay SG on time to avoid penalty interest and disallowance of superannuation deductions.\n\n\nPractical tips to avoid the PSI rules\n\n\n1. Aim to pass the Results test – get paid for outcomes, not hours\nStructure contracts so you’re engaged to deliver a specific result (fixed price, milestones, completion deliverables), supply key tools/equipment where it makes sense, and accept liability to fix defects at your cost. If all three apply for most (that’s over 75%) of your PSI, you’re in the best position to show you’re running a business, not just selling time.\n\nPractical moves: switch hourly billing to fixed-price or milestone fees; add deliverable and warranty clauses; show you provide core equipment/software (or why it isn’t needed).\n\n2. Build a real client base - meet the Unrelated Clients test properly\nHaving more than one client isn’t enough. The ATO wants to see that clients came from you offering services to the public (not just word-of-mouth). Think visible, traceable marketing that directly leads to work.\nPractical moves: advertise; keep records linking enquiries to ads or listings; use public proposals/tenders; save website/LinkedIn evidence and client emails showing how they found you.\n\n3. Consider the Employment test - get others to do principal work\nIf at least 20% (by value) of the principal work is done by people you employ or contract (and you meet the 80% rule), you may pass this test. Admin support doesn’t count – it has to be core service delivery.\nPractical moves: document tasks and timesheets showing who did what; use contracts with subcontractors/employees who produce deliverables, not just admin.\n\n4. Get proper, separate business premises if it’s possible\nTo pass the Business Premises test, your premises must be separate from home and client sites and mainly used for your business.\nPractical moves: lease or sublet a small studio, office, or exclusive long-term coworking desk; keep lease agreements and utility bills showing business use.\n\n5. Keep client income under the 80% threshold (or apply for a PSBD)\nIf 80%+ of your PSI comes from one client (and associates), your options to rely on other PSB tests are restricted. Diversifying helps – if you genuinely can’t, a PSB Determination (PSBD) might be an option.\nPractical moves: track income by client and their associates; plan marketing to reduce reliance on a single client; if you’re stuck with one, consider applying for a PSBD with solid evidence.\n\n6. Document everything - the ATO wants evidence, not claims\nGood records often decide PSI outcomes. The ATO looks at how you got work, who did it, the terms, and how costs were allocated.\nPractical moves: keep contracts, proposals, emails, invoices, marketing screenshots, timesheets, employee/contractor agreements and proof of payment.\n\n7. Use the ATO tools - decision tool and PSB determination\nBefore you restructure or rely on PSB status, use the ATO’s PSI decision tool and, if needed, the PSB determination process.\nPractical moves: run the online PSI decision tool and save the output; if you’re borderline, apply for a PSBD.\n\n8. Don’t treat the company as a tax-avoidance device\nThe PSI rules are anti–income splitting. You can’t just push PSI through a company or family members and expect to claim extra deductions, especially for non-principal work.\nPractical moves: only pay associates for genuine, market-value services that contribute to principal work; keep clear role descriptions and timesheets.\n\n9. If you may’t meet the tests, manage PSI compliance proactively\nIf PSI rules will apply, plan for them rather than hoping they don’t: attribute PSI correctly, stick to allowed (employee-style) deductions, and manage PAYG and cashflow.\nPractical moves: talk to an accountant early; separate PSI from non-PSI income in your records; budget for extra PAYG and tax.\n\n10. Get professional advice and re-test each year\nThe ATO’s guidance and your circumstances change over time, and PSI tests are applied each income year.\nPractical moves: get a registered tax agent or adviser to review your setup annually and re-run the decision tool each year.", "content_text_zh": "If most of your freelance or contracting income comes from your own effort, the ATO may classify it as PSI. Beatrice’s journey as a UX designer shows how PSI works in real life and when the PSB tests can help you avoid PSI restrictions.\n\nEver wondered if your freelance gigs, design work, or side hustle might be caught under the ATO’s Personal Services Income (PSI) rules? You’re not alone.\n\nIn Australia, if most of your income comes from your personal skills and effort, the ATO may classify it as PSI - not to trap you, but to make sure there’s fair tax treatment (especially when people use companies or trusts mainly to lower their tax).\n\nLet’s make this easy - and fun (well, more fun than it should be!) - to understand.\n\nWe’ll walk through a real-world story of Beatrice, a User Experience (UX) designer who starts as a sole trader, quickly expands her client base, and eventually operates a full design business through a company. Along the way, we’ll see how her income gets defined as PSI, and how the PSB tests (Results, the 80% rule, Unrelated Clients, Employment, and Business Premises) apply at every stage.\n\n\nQuick Summary:\n\n\nWhat is PSI?\nIncome mainly from your own skills, effort, or expertise (over 50% of the value).\n\nWho it affects:\nFreelancers, contractors, consultants, creatives, specialists – anyone paid for their personal effort.\n\nPurpose of the PSI rules:\nTo stop income-splitting through structures like companies or trusts and to limit the deductions for employee-like contracting workers.\n\nBusiness structure doesn’t matter:\nPSI rules apply whether you’re a sole trader or have a company, trust, or partnership – the income’s still attributed to you.\n\nHow to avoid PSI restrictions: \nIf you pass any of the Personal Services Business (PSB) tests (these are called: Results, the 80% rule, Unrelated Clients, Employment, and Business Premises), the PSI rules probably won’t apply to you.\n\n\nUnderstanding PSI and PSB — before we dive into Beatrice’s story\n\n\nBefore we get into Beatrice’s journey, let’s quickly look at two key ATO concepts: Personal Services Income (PSI) and Personal Services Business (PSB).\n\nPersonal Services Income (PSI) is income that’s mainly a reward for your own personal skills or effort. It’s common for freelancers, consultants, specialists and creatives - think designers, engineers, consultants, and contractors who get paid for the work they personally do. The PSI rules don’t affect you if you're an employee receiving only salary or wages.\n\nIf you earn PSI, special tax rules apply to prevent you from “splitting” that income through a company, trust, or partnership to reduce tax. In other words, the ATO will generally attribute that income back to you, the person who did the work, and the deductions you can claim against this income are limited too.\n\nHowever, you can qualify as a Personal Services Business (PSB) if you meet certain tests. If you do, the PSI rules won’t apply, and you can treat your income more like business income.\n\nHere are the four PSB tests the ATO uses:\n\nResults test - To pass this test, you need to meet all 3 of the following conditions for at least 75% of your PSI you earned:\n\n• You’re paid to produce a result.\n\n• You use your own tools/equipment, and\n\n• You’re responsible for fixing mistakes.\n\nUnrelated clients test - You get income from two or more unrelated clients (and their associates).\n\nEmployment test - You hire others (employees or contractors) to do at least 20% of the principal work.\n\nBusiness premises test - You keep business premises that are separate from your home and clients’ premises.\n\nYou can self-assess as a Personal Services Business (PSB) if either:\n\n• You pass the Results test for most of your PSI (at least 75%), or\n\n• You pass one of the other PSB tests and no single client (or their related associates) provides more than 80% of your PSI.\n\nIf you can’t self-assess as a PSB, you may be able to apply for a PSB determination (PSBD) from the ATO.\n\n\nWhat to Do If the PSI Rules Don’t Apply\n\n\nEven if the PSI rules don’t apply to your income, you still need to declare all your Personal Services Income (PSI) on your tax return. This means reporting your earnings just like any other business or personal income. When the rules don’t apply, you can generally claim the full range of deductions that relate to earning the income, without the limitations that usually apply under the PSI rules.\n\n\nWhat to Do If the PSI Rules Do Apply\n\n\nIf the PSI rules apply to you, you’ve got to follow steps to comply with the ATO’s requirements. First, attribute the PSI to the person who performed the work - that’s usually you - even if the income was paid to a company, trust, or partnership. Next, calculate your net PSI by deducting only the expenses allowed under the PSI rules, which are generally limited to those an employee could claim.\n\nYou may also have additional PAYG withholding or instalment obligations if the PSI received by your business wasn’t promptly paid as salary or wages to the person doing the work. “Promptly paid” means paying the amount by the 14th day after the relevant PAYG payment period in which the PSI was received.\n\nNavigating the PSI rules can feel very tricky, but the ATO’s got plenty of detailed guidance if you need it.\n\nNext, we follow Beatrice’s story to see how the rules play out in real life - and what it means for her taxes along the way.\n\n\nBeatrice’s Journey: UX Designer Turned Business Owner\n\n\n\nStage 1: From Employee to Sole Trader (2023)\n\n\nBeatrice used to work as a UX designer for a software company X Pty Ltd, creating user workflows and interfaces.

Even though Beatrice didn’t receive it as wages, the company still needs to:\n\n• Calculate additional PAYGW on this $120,000 based on her marginal tax rate\n\n• Report and pay the additional PAYGW through amended BAS for each quarter\n\n• Provide Beatrice with an annual PAYG payment summary/income statement showing both salary with normal tax withheld and additional PAYGW\n\n• Submit an annual report to the ATO at year-end, showing additional PAYG withholding at the end of the income year\n\n\nStage 3: Expanding Through Advertising (2025)\n\n\nBeatrice continues to grow her business and consults an accountant about PSI rules. She places ads on LinkedIn and Facebook and creates a website showcasing her work. She gets two new clients, Z Pty Ltd and A Pty Ltd. She’s still paid hourly for her UX design services and now fully relies on her own laptop, software subscriptions, and design tools.\n\nTo maintain efficient operations, Beatrice Designs Pty Ltd continues running smoothly. Henry supports administrative tasks, including invoicing, emails, and client calls.\n\nFinancial Year Overview:\n\nIncome (excl. GST):\n\n• $100,000 from X Pty Ltd (46% of PSI)\n\n• $70,000 from Y Pty Ltd (32% of PSI)\n\n• $25,000 from Z Pty Ltd (11% of PSI)\n\n• $25,000 from A Pty Ltd (11% of PSI)\n\nTotal Income: $220,000\n\nExpenses (excl. GST):\n\n• $45,000 salary to Beatrice (+$5,400 super)\n\n• $45,000 salary to Henry (+$5,400 super)\n\n• $2,000 accounting fees\n\n• $1,000 software subscriptions\n\n• $329 ASIC fee\n\nTotal Expense: $104,129\n\n\nPSI and PSB Considerations:\n\n\nResults test – Beatrice fails ❌\n\nBeatrice’s still paid hourly, not for a specific outcome.\n\n80% rule - Beatrice passes ✅\nWith plenty of clients and no single client providing more than 80% of her PSI, she passes the 80% rule and can consider other PSB tests.\n\nUnrelated clients test - Beatrice passes ✅\nBeatrice gained Z Pty Ltd and A Pty Ltd through public advertising, satisfying the “offer to the public” requirement. Also, clients X, Y, Z and A are unrelated and not associated with each other, meaning the unrelated clients test is met.\n\nEmployment test - Beatrice fails ❌ \nBeatrice does all principal work herself; Henry only handles administrative tasks.\n\nBusiness premises test - Beatrice fails ❌ \nBeatrice works from home without separate business premises.\n\n\nTax Implications\n\n\nBeatrice’s PSI now passes both the 80% rule and the unrelated clients test, which means she can self-assess as a Personal Services Business (PSB). As a result, the PSI rules no longer apply to her income.\n\nThis has several practical effects:\n\n• Income Reporting: The income remains assessable at the company level and has to be reported under the relevant label in the company tax return. The resulting net profit is then taxed at the company tax rate of 25%.\n\n• Deductions: Beatrice can claim a broader range of business expenses, including software subscriptions, ASIC fees, accounting fees, salaries and super to herself and Henry, and home-based business expenses (both running costs and occupancy costs). She’s no longer restricted by PSI-specific deduction limits.\n\n• Payroll Compliance: Beatrice Designs Pty Ltd must register for PAYG withholding (PAYGW) and report wages and PAYGW through its BAS. Pay runs should be completed using STP-enabled payroll software. The Superannuation Guarantee (SG) obligation’s also triggered, and the company must pay SG on time to avoid penalty interest and disallowance of superannuation deductions.\n\n\nPractical tips to avoid the PSI rules\n\n\n1. Aim to pass the Results test – get paid for outcomes, not hours\nStructure contracts so you’re engaged to deliver a specific result (fixed price, milestones, completion deliverables), supply key tools/equipment where it makes sense, and accept liability to fix defects at your cost. If all three apply for most (that’s over 75%) of your PSI, you’re in the best position to show you’re running a business, not just selling time.\n\nPractical moves: switch hourly billing to fixed-price or milestone fees; add deliverable and warranty clauses; show you provide core equipment/software (or why it isn’t needed).\n\n2. Build a real client base - meet the Unrelated Clients test properly\nHaving more than one client isn’t enough. The ATO wants to see that clients came from you offering services to the public (not just word-of-mouth). Think visible, traceable marketing that directly leads to work.\nPractical moves: advertise; keep records linking enquiries to ads or listings; use public proposals/tenders; save website/LinkedIn evidence and client emails showing how they found you.\n\n3. Consider the Employment test - get others to do principal work\nIf at least 20% (by value) of the principal work is done by people you employ or contract (and you meet the 80% rule), you may pass this test. Admin support doesn’t count – it has to be core service delivery.\nPractical moves: document tasks and timesheets showing who did what; use contracts with subcontractors/employees who produce deliverables, not just admin.\n\n4. Get proper, separate business premises if it’s possible\nTo pass the Business Premises test, your premises must be separate from home and client sites and mainly used for your business.\nPractical moves: lease or sublet a small studio, office, or exclusive long-term coworking desk; keep lease agreements and utility bills showing business use.\n\n5. Keep client income under the 80% threshold (or apply for a PSBD)\nIf 80%+ of your PSI comes from one client (and associates), your options to rely on other PSB tests are restricted. Diversifying helps – if you genuinely can’t, a PSB Determination (PSBD) might be an option.\nPractical moves: track income by client and their associates; plan marketing to reduce reliance on a single client; if you’re stuck with one, consider applying for a PSBD with solid evidence.\n\n6. Document everything - the ATO wants evidence, not claims\nGood records often decide PSI outcomes. The ATO looks at how you got work, who did it, the terms, and how costs were allocated.\nPractical moves: keep contracts, proposals, emails, invoices, marketing screenshots, timesheets, employee/contractor agreements and proof of payment.\n\n7. Use the ATO tools - decision tool and PSB determination\nBefore you restructure or rely on PSB status, use the ATO’s PSI decision tool and, if needed, the PSB determination process.\nPractical moves: run the online PSI decision tool and save the output; if you’re borderline, apply for a PSBD.\n\n8. Don’t treat the company as a tax-avoidance device\nThe PSI rules are anti–income splitting. You can’t just push PSI through a company or family members and expect to claim extra deductions, especially for non-principal work.\nPractical moves: only pay associates for genuine, market-value services that contribute to principal work; keep clear role descriptions and timesheets.\n\n9. If you can’t meet the tests, manage PSI compliance proactively\nIf PSI rules will apply, plan for them rather than hoping they don’t: attribute PSI correctly, stick to allowed (employee-style) deductions, and manage PAYG and cashflow.\nPractical moves: talk to an accountant early; separate PSI from non-PSI income in your records; budget for extra PAYG and tax.\n\n10. Get professional advice and re-test each year\nThe ATO’s guidance and your circumstances change over time, and PSI tests are applied each income year.\nPractical moves: get a registered tax agent or adviser to review your setup annually and re-run the decision tool each year."}, {"title": "How to Pay Yourself from a Company (Without Tax Surprises)", "title_zh": "从你的公司拿钱：你需要知道什么", "date": "2025-12-03", "readTime": 15, "author": "Livia Lin", "source": "https://annamoney.au/blog/guides/taking-money-out-of-your-company/", "excerpt": "You run a company and you’ve doing well.

Now you want to take some money out of your company for yourself. Hooray! But before you rush off to do it, have a think about how you want to pay yourself, because doing it the wrong way can trigger big tax headaches. Below is a practical approach to do it correctly.\n\n\nOverview at a Glance\n\n\nTaking money out of your company is to be expected - how else are you going to get paid? But how you do it matters.\n\n• If you treat it like salary – it’s simple but you need payroll systems.\n\n• If you treat it like a dividend -  you need profit, the correct share class, and formal declaration.\n\n• If you treat it like a loan - you need an agreement, payment terms, interest and repayment schedules. You also need to be aware of the timeline.\n\n\nWhy this matters\n\n\nEven if you own the company, your company’s money isn’t automatically your money.\n\nThink of your company as a separate person with its own bank account. When you take money out of it, the ATO (that’s the Australian Taxation Office) wants to know why - is it:\n\n• a wage or salary\n\n• a dividend (profit distribution)\n\n• a loan you’ll pay back later?\n\nIf you just transfer money out without recording what it’s for, the ATO will probably assume you’ve taken company profits for yourself - like paying yourself a bonus - and they’ll tax you on it.\n\n\nA quick look at tax credits\n\n\nBefore we talk about how you pay yourself from a company, it helps to understand how tax credits work in Australia—especially franking system and Division 7A, which is a set of rules designed to stop company owners from taking money out of the business tax-free.\n\nA company pays tax at the 25% corporate tax rate. But when those profits are later paid to you as a shareholder, they’re treated as dividends and taxed at your personal tax rate (which can be as high as 45% plus medicare levy 2%).\n\nThis is where the franking system comes in.\n\n\nWhat is the franking system?\n\n\nAustralia uses a system called imputation, which simply means this:\nthe ATO doesn’t want company profits to be taxed twice—once in the company’s hands and again in yours.\n\nSo if a company has already paid tax on its profits, it can pass that tax on to shareholders as franking credits.\nWhen you receive a franked dividend, you also receive those credits, which you may use to reduce your own tax bill.\n\nIf you receive an unfranked dividend, it means the company hasn’t paid tax on that profit. In that case, you pay tax on the full amount at your personal marginal rate.\n\n\nWhy this matters\n\n\nIf you take money out of your company the wrong way, the ATO can treat it as a “deemed dividend” under Div7A rules. Typically they don’t come with franking credits - so they end up being fully taxable.\n\nThis means:\n\n• The money you take from your company will be added to your personal income, and\n\n• You may end up paying more tax than if it had been set up properly.\n\n\nWhat are your main options for putting money in your pocket?\n\n\nBelow are the three common ways to take money out - with easy pros and cons.\n\n\nOption 1 - Pay yourself a salary or wage (through payroll/STP)\n\n\nPros\n\n• Straightforward: you’re treated like an employee.\n\n• Tax is withheld and reported automatically via STP/BAS.\n\n• Superannuation (SG) is handled as part of payroll.\n\n• Great for stable, regular income.\n\nCons\n\n• You need STP-enabled payroll software.\n\n• The company must withhold PAYG tax and pay super.\n\n• Ongoing admin (or outsource to your accountant).\n\nBest for when:\n\nyou’re working in the business and want regular pay, or\n\nthe company can manage ongoing payroll and super payments.\n\n\nOption 2 - Declare a dividend (shareholder distribution)\n\n\nPros\n\n• If the company has paid tax, dividends can carry franking credits to reduce your personal tax.\n\n• Good for one-off profit distributions.\n\n• Useful when your company has accumulated franking credits you want to use.\n\nCons\n\n• You need distributable profits to pay dividends.\n\n• You must treat all shareholders of the same share class equally.\n\n• Requires documentation (dividend statements, minutes) and correct tax reporting.\n\nBest for when:\n\nThe company has clear profits and you want to share those profits with shareholders rather than create a loan.\n\nThe company has unused franking credits and you want to avoid extra tax on money the company already paid tax on.\n\nAn example: you issued yourself $10,000 dividend\n\nIf the company already paid $2,500 tax on the profit, you receive a $10,000 dividend with a $2,500 franking credit. You declare $12,500 income but subtract the $2,500 credit from your personal tax bill - preventing double taxation.\n\n⚠️Tax Warning!\n\nFranking credit deficit\n\nIf the company gives out too many franking credits, it may need to pay extra tax to top up the franking account.\n\nFranking credit trap\n\nIf the corporate tax rate falls (e.g., 27.5% → 25%), some credits from earlier years may become “stuck” because you may only frank dividends at the current lower rate.\n\nPlanning ahead helps avoid accidentally wasting credits.\n\nTo manage this, consider:\n\n• Paying dividends earlier (before a rate drop takes effect) to use up higher-rate credits.\n\n• Also, review your personal tax position — if you’re on a lower marginal tax rate, you may receive a refund of franking credits. If your personal tax rate is high, you may prefer that the company retain profits until it can pay fully franked dividends at the higher rate OR until other strategies can unlock trapped credits.\n\n• Looking ahead, it’s worth planning for future profits to make sure trapped credits can be used later and checking your company’s base rate entity status each year, as this affects the maximum franking rate you may apply. A base rate entity is generally a company with turnover under $50 million and where no more than 80% of its income is from passive sources such as rent, interest, or dividends.\n\nYou can find more information about franking credits on the ATO website.\n\n\nOption 3 - Take money as a Division 7A loan (formal director loan)\n\n\nThis is when the company “lends” you money. It’s fine — as long as you follow the rules.\n\nPros\n\n• Immediate cashflow without payroll and PAYG withholding.\n\n• No immediate tax if the loan is compliant.\n\n• You get extra time before the first minimum yearly repayment (MYR).\n\nCons\n\n• Requires a written loan agreement by the company’s lodgment day.\n\n• Needs minimum yearly repayments (principal + interest).\n\n• Interest must be charged at/above the ATO benchmark rate (8.37% for 2025–26).\n\n• If you break the rules, the loan becomes a deemed unfranked dividend — and fully taxable.\n\nBest for when:\n\n• You need cash now and the company (and you) are confident you may meet the repayment schedule.\n\n• You want to avoid payroll and super in the short term but can commit to formalising the loan and making minimum yearly repayments.\n\n• You are okay with more documentation / formal structure, and are comfortable with the idea of it being a loan (not a “free withdrawal”).\n\nYou can find more information about a complying Div7A loan on the ATO website.\n\nAn example: you withdraw $50,000\n\nImagine Save Money Pty Ltd lends its shareholder (Ben) $50,000 on 9  May 2022.\n\nIf Ben had simply transferred $50,000 from the company to himself without any documentation, loan agreement, or formal payroll/salary/dividend declaration and he has not repaid it back to the company, then:\n\nThe money would likely be treated by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) as an unfranked deemed dividend.\n\nBen would include the $50,000 in his assessable income, with no franking credits, and could end up paying tax at his individual marginal rate 45% on that amount.\n\nIf the company doesn’t have a distributable surplus, this may limit the deemed dividend - but it’s still risky.\n\nNow, compare that to the complying Div7A loan route:\n\nSave Money Pty Ltd and Ben set up a Division 7A complying loan agreement before the company lodges its tax return for the year ended 30 June 2023. The loan follows the required rules: for example, it is unsecured, has a 7‑year term, and charges interest at the ATO benchmark rate.\n\nHere’s what happens next:\n\nCompany side:\n\nEach year, the company records the interest Ben pays as income.\n\nThat interest is taxed at the company’s rate.\n\nBen’s side:\n\nBen must make minimum yearly repayments (MYRs) — covering both principal and interest — by 30 June each year until the loan is fully repaid.\n\nIf all MYRs are made, the loan avoids being treated as a deemed dividend.\n\nWhether Ben can deduct the interest depends on how he uses the money (usually deductible if used for income-producing purposes).\n\nMust plan ahead because payments are due every 30 June while the loan is outstanding.\n\nBen can choose to repay the loan faster than 7 years if he wants.\n\nBen can make/offset the MYRs by declaring normal dividends with franking credits and wages to himself.\n\nBen gets the cash immediately but does not pay ‘tax’ on the loan itself right away. Tax is deferred until the company earns interest or if the loan is later converted into a dividend or salary.\n\n*Exact repayments for later years cannot be finalised until the ATO publishes benchmark rates for those years.\n\n⚠️Tax Warning! Section 109R — “Repay and redraw” trap\n\nIf you repay a loan just before 30 June but take the money out again straight after, the ATO can ignore the repayment and still treat the loan as unpaid. This can trigger a deemed dividend.\n\nFor example, Ben withdraws $50,000 from Save Money Pty Ltd and puts it in his personal home loan offset account to reduce interest throughout the year. Right before 30 June, he transfers the $50,000 back to the company to “repay” his Division 7A loan, only to withdraw the same amount again immediately after year-end.\n\nAt first glance, it looks like he made the repayment, but under Section 109R, the ATO can disregard this repayment because it was not a genuine repayment. The loan remains outstanding, and a deemed unfranked dividend may arise, creating an unexpected tax liability.\n\n\nTips for Making a Division 7A Loan Complying\n\n\nHave a Written Loan Agreement: Include loan amount, interest rate (ATO benchmark or higher), terms.\n\nMake Minimum Yearly Repayments (MYRs): Pay principal + interest annually by 30 June. Missing payments can trigger a deemed dividend. Use the ATO Division 7A calculator to work out the correct MYR.\n\nPlan Ahead & Ensure Cashflow: Make sure you may meet repayments each year. Consider both your personal finances and the company’s needs to avoid surprises.\n\nAvoid Repay & Redraw Schemes: Don’t repay and immediately borrow the same funds again — the ATO can disregard this under Section 109R.\n\n\nCheck-list for year-end cleanup\n\n\nAs you approach the end of the financial year (30 June), go through this:\n\n• What’s the outstanding director loan balance?\n\n• Can you pay yourself a salary or bonus this year?\n\n• Do you have enough profit to declare a dividend?\n\n• Does your company have unused franking credits?\n\n• Do all shareholders hold the same class of shares?\n\n• If you’re doing a loan—do you have the written agreement in place and are the yearly repayments happening?\n\n• Make a decision before the company lodges its tax return to avoid surprises.\n\nGot questions?

Consider both your personal finances and the company’s needs to avoid surprises.\n\nAvoid Repay & Redraw Schemes: Don’t repay and immediately borrow the same funds again — the ATO can disregard this under Section 109R.\n\n\nCheck-list for year-end cleanup\n\n\nAs you approach the end of the financial year (30 June), go through this:\n\n• What’s the outstanding director loan balance?\n\n• Can you pay yourself a salary or bonus this year?\n\n• Do you have enough profit to declare a dividend?\n\n• Does your company have unused franking credits?\n\n• Do all shareholders hold the same class of shares?\n\n• If you’re doing a loan—do you have the written agreement in place and are the yearly repayments happening?\n\n• Make a decision before the company lodges its tax return to avoid surprises.\n\nGot questions?

This article explains the key differences between a sole trader and a company in plain English, so you may choose the right structure for your goals.\n\nStarting a business in Australia? One of the biggest decisions you’ll make early on is how to set it up. Should you keep things simple and go it alone as a sole trader, or register a company and give your business its own legal life?\n\nBoth options can work perfectly - it really depends on your goals, how much you’re earning, and how much risk you’re willing to take. Get it right from the start, and you’ll save yourself a lot of time, stress, and tax surprises later on.\n\nLet’s break it down in plain English.\n\n\nWhat’s a Sole Trader?\n\n\nBeing a sole trader means it’s just you - you run the show, keep the profits, and make all the decisions. It’s quick and affordable to set up, and perfect for freelancers, small side hustles, or anyone testing a business idea.\n\nThe flip side? You and the business are legally the same. So if your business owes money or gets into trouble, your personal assets (like your home or car) could be on the line. You’ll also report all business income and expenses on your personal tax return.\n\nBest for:\n\n• Solo operators and freelancers\n\n• Low-cost, low-risk businesses\n\n• Anyone starting out or testing an idea\n\n\nWhat’s a Company?\n\n\nA company is a separate legal entity. It’s like a totally different person in the eyes of the law. It has its own ABN, ACN, and TFN. That means it can earn money, own assets, sign contracts, and take on debts in its own name.\n\nYou (and any co-owners) become shareholders, and the company directors make the day-to-day decisions. The company files its own tax return and pays tax at the company rate — 25% for small businesses in 2025.\n\nBecause it’s separate, your personal liability is limited — so your house and savings are generally protected if something goes wrong.\n\nBest for:\n\n• Businesses planning to grow or hire staff\n\n• Those wanting to attract investors or raise capital\n\n• Companies holding valuable assets or operating in higher-risk industries\n\n\nWhen Does It Make Sense to Switch from Sole Trader to Company?\n\n\nA lot of small businesses start out as sole traders - it’s simple, flexible, easy to run. But as profits grow, a company structure often makes more sense.\n\nYou might think about switching if:\n\n• Your taxable income consistently hits $130k–$150k+\n\n• You want to protect your personal assets\n\n• You plan to reinvest profits or bring in investors\n\n• You’re hiring more employees or moving into a higher-risk industry\n\n\nMeet Emma – A Real Life Example\n\n\nEmma runs a catering business in Sydney.\n\nAs a sole trader:\n\n• She earned about $140,000 profit in the 2025 financial year\n\n• Paid tax at her personal rate (37% + Medicare levy)\n\n• Worked mostly with contractors\n\n• Kept things simple with GST on a cash basis\n\nAs her business grew, so did her profits (and her tax bill). She realised she could keep more of her earnings if her business paid the 25% company tax rate instead of her personal rate. She also wanted to hire permanent staff and protect her personal assets.\n\nSo, she made the switch.\n\n*Rounded, simplified figures for example purposes\n\nBy forming a company, Emma could reinvest more of her profit, hire employees, and build credibility with clients and investors.\n\n\nWhat Actually Changes When You Form a Company\n\n\n• New business identity: Register with ANNA to get your company ABN, ACN, TFN, and business account in one go.\n\n• Hiring more staff: Run payroll, make PAYG payments, report GST and PAYGW in your BAS.\n\n• Company tax: Lodge a company tax return and pay 25% tax on profits.\n\n• Paying yourself: Take money out as wages (taxed as salary) or dividends (with franking credits).\n\n• Asset protection: Your personal assets are safer — though directors still have some responsibilities.\n\n• Growth & investment: Easier to raise capital and attract investors.\n\n• Branding boost: “Pty Ltd” adds credibility to your business name.\n\n\nWhat About Transferring Assets (like a Car)?\n\n\nEmma’s car is a depreciating asset, so it loses value over time. When she moves it from her sole trader business into her company, it triggers a 'balancing adjustment event'. In simple terms, any gain or loss from the car affects her personal taxable income.\n\nThat means any gain or loss may affect her personal taxable income - but there’s a possible small business restructure rollover (Subdivision 328‑G) that can help her avoid immediate tax, if she meet certain conditions.\n\nIn practice, most business cars lose value, so any gain or loss is usually small, and rollovers rarely provide a significant tax benefit.\n\nEmma will also need to transfer the registration and pay stamp duty, so the company becomes the legal owner.\n\n\nBefore You Decide – Ask Yourself\n\n\n• How much profit do I expect in the next few years?\n\n• How much risk am I comfortable taking personally?\n\n• Will I reinvest profits or distribute them?\n\n• Am I planning to hire employees or attract investors?\n\n• Do I need asset protection or extra credibility?\n\n• Am I okay with more paperwork for better long-term benefits?\n\nA Quick Note on Personal Services Income (PSI)\n\nIf most of your income comes from your personal skills or labour - like consulting or freelancing - PSI rules might apply. They can affect how you claim deductions and whether income-splitting through a company is allowed. We’ve got a separate blog explaining PSI in plain English.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nSole trader: simple, flexible, and low-cost - great for starting out.\nCompany: structured, protective, and scalable - great for growing.\n\nMany Australian businesses begin as sole traders and move to a company when it’s time to level up.\n\nKey takeaway: Pick the structure that fits your goals, income, and comfort with risk. And before you lock it in, have a quick chat with your accountant - or with us at ANNA Money - to make sure you’re set up the smart way.\n\nGot questions? Reach out to us via app chat.

Our survival guide helps Aussie small businesses/companies tackle tax, BAS, and compliance without the headache, so you may wrap things up with confidence\n\n\nOverview at a Glance\n\n\n• Always keep your books tidy: Keep financial records and bank reconciliations up to date\n\n• Start early: May is the ideal time to start planning for tax and collating key documents\n\n• Finalise payroll: Complete STP reporting and ensure all employee entitlements are paid on time\n\n• Year-end adjustments: Post all adjusting journals to finalise your accounts for the financial year\n\n• Lodge and pay on time: Review your business tax obligations to stay compliant\n\n\nWhy EOFY Matters for Small Companies\n\n\nFor directors and owners of Australian small proprietary companies, End of Financial Year (EOFY) is more than just lodging a tax return. It’s your annual opportunity to assess your business health, plan for cash flow and tax savings, and make sure you’re compliant with the ATO, ASIC, and other regulators. Yes, it’s a series of obligations, but it’s also a good time to take a snapshot of your company and make sure everything is heading in the right direction. So with that in mind, here’s your comprehensive guide to getting your business  EOFY-ready.\n\n\nWhen is EOFY?\n\n\nFor most small businesses in Australia, the financial year ends on 30 June each year. Each financial year covers the period from 1 July to 30 June.\n\n\nWhy start early in May?\n\n\nAs with most things in life, it’s not a good idea to leave your EOFY to the last minute. \nMay is the perfect time for small business owners to get ahead of EOFY. Starting early gives you time to organise records, identify deductions, review cash flow, and make strategic decisions before 30 June, without a panicky scramble before the deadline.\nAccounts get busy! From March onwards, accountants enter the most hectic period, finalising prior-year lodgements, making it harder to get their time and attention - and if you wait until they contact you, you risk missing opportunities for tax savings, cash flow planning, and stress-free compliance.\n\n\nGet your records in order\n\n\nBefore the admin piles up, take some time to get organised. Key tasks for small business owners include:\n\n• Reconciling all business bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and petty cash\n\n• Making sure income and expenses are correctly categorised and recorded\n\n• Collating all your records for tax-sensitive items. These include:\n\n• Legal feesHome office expensesAsset purchases or improvementsLoan agreements and repayment schedulesMaterial business expenses\n\n• Verifying your accounts receivable (that’s money owed to you) and accounts payable (money you owe)\n\n• Reviewing your  insurance policies\n\n• Checking that your ATO and ASIC obligations are up to date, including:\n\n• Outstanding BAS/IAS, income tax, FBT, PAYG instalmentsOutstanding super paymentsOutstanding ASIC fees\n\n• Renewing business name registrations\n\n• Reviewing company details, and storing constitution and governance documents\n\nWith ANNA Money +Taxes, you may upload and attach evidence directly to your transactions, automating your bookkeeping all year round, making EOFY preparation easy and hassle-free. Your taxes are much simpler if you keep on top of them throughout the year, rather than leaving them until the paperwork has mounted up.\n\n\nPlanning before 30 June\n\n\nGood planning before EOFY can help reduce your tax liability (that’s how much tax you owe) and improve your cash flow. By reviewing your business activities and financial position early, you may take advantage of available concessions, maximise the deductions, and set yourself up for a smoother year ahead.\n\nHave a think about these strategies before 30 June:\n\n• Do a stocktake and write off obsolete or slow-moving inventory\n\n• Write off any bad debts\n\n• Delay issuing invoices if it benefits your tax position (deferring income to next year)\n\n• Review and apply small business tax concessions\n\n• Prepay expenses such as superannuation, rent, insurance, and subscriptions\n\n• Take advantage of the instant asset write-off for eligible assets purchased and installed by 30 June\n\n• Prepare budgets and forecast your tax position to plan cash flow and payments\n\n• Review Director Loan balances and Division 7A risks\n\n• Evaluate your business structure and ask for advice if you need it\n\n• Set aside money for income tax, June BAS, super, and other tax obligations\n\n• Ask for Quantity Surveyors (depreciation report) for business premises refurbishment if applicable\n\n• Talk to experts if you’re unsure of anything\n\n\nActions after 30 June\n\n\nOnce the financial year closes, finalise all pending tasks to make sure you’re compliant and a have a smooth, straightforward transition into the new year. You should also:\n\n• Collect together all your year-end documents, including:\n\n• Bank and credit card statementsYear-end tax summaries for investmentsLoan statements with updated balances\n\n• Finalise payroll processing and lodge STP reports by 14 July\n\n• Lodge and pay the June BAS and super by 28 July\n\n• Record year-end adjustments, including but not limited to:\n\n• Division 7A prepayments, accruals, provisionsTrading stock adjustmentsDepreciation and amortisationHire purchase adjustmentsAdjusting entries due to prior-year timing difference\n\n• Review major sales and purchases\n\n• Prepare a Profit & Loss statement and compare results with last year\n\n• Reconcile Balance Sheet items and make sure supporting documents are on file\n\n• Reconcile ATO tax liabilities, including GST, PAYGW, and income tax\n\n• Review Director Loan accounts\n\n• Assess available tax incentives and eligibility, such as:\n\n• Prior year lossesAvailable franking creditsInstant asset write-offR&D tax incentivesCapital gains/lossesEntertainment and donationsLate super paymentsBad debtsFines and penaltiesCapital expenses\n\n• Know your due dates and lodge your company income tax return, taxable payments annual report (TPAR) for certain industries\n\n• Finalise budgets, cash flow forecasts, and business plans for the new financial year\n\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n\nAs you may imagine, EOFY can feel overwhelming - but with the right preparation, it becomes an opportunity, not a headache. By starting early, staying organised, and making informed financial decisions, you may maximise your tax savings, keep your business compliant, and set yourself up for a stronger year ahead. Whether you prefer to DIY or let technology handle the heavy lifting, tools like ANNA’s +Taxes can take the stress out of EOFY and help your business run smoothly all year round.

Learn tax rates, lodgement rules, and key tips to manage your business tax obligations effectively\n\n\nOverview at a Glance:\n\n\n• Company tax rate: 25% on net profits for most small company businesses\n\n• Company Income Tax due dates: The due date may vary. Generally, 28 Feb (self-prepared with no pass return outstanding) or up to 15 May with a tax agent\n\n• How to lodge: Submit your company income tax return via a SBR-enabled software, or through your accountant\n\n• Penalties: Late tax returns can mean fines from $330 plus daily compounding interest\n\n\nWhat is Company Income Tax?\n\n\nIt’s the tax your company pays on its business profits - that means the total income minus your business expenses. For the 2025 financial year (1 July 2025 to 30 June 2026), the Company Income Tax rate is 25% for small businesses. \n\nEvery company in Australia needs to lodge a Company Income Tax Return once a year.\n\n\nWhat goes in a Company Income Tax Return?\n\n\nHere are the key things you’ll need to include in your Company Income Tax Return:\n\n• Total income: Such as sales, services, and any other money coming in\n\n• Business expenses: Such as rent, wages, subscriptions, the usual suspects\n\n• Any losses from previous years: Sometimes previous losses can be used to offset the profit your business has made in current period profit. So include any previous tax losses, they may help you reduce the tax you’ll have to pay\n\n• Tax instalments already paid: Tax instalments are pre-paid taxes that ATO may need in certain circumstances. When you’re filling in your final year end assessment, make sure to include the taxes you’ve already paid so you’re not taxed twice\n\nNeed a clearer picture? See a sample return for FY 2025.\n\n\nWhen is Company Income Tax due?\n\n\nGenerally, the lodgement and payment date for small companies is 28 February if you lodge it yourself, rather than using a tax agent. If you have any previous year returns still outstanding, the due date will be 31 October. If you’re using a tax agent or ask for a deferral, you might get a bit more time to file your Return.\n\nStressed about deadlines? Your ANNA tax calendar’s got your back with deadline reminders tailored just for you.\n\n\nQuick Tips:\n\n\n• Keep it Clean No cents. No rounding up. Whole dollars only on Income Tax.\n\n• Nothing to Report? Just lodge a NIL Income Tax Return through ANNA.\n\n• Oops! Made a mistake? Lodge a Company Income Tax Amendment to fix the error.

If you're registered for GST, you're expected to charge it on sales, pay it to the ATO, and claim back the GST on your eligible business purchases.\n\n\nWho needs to register for GST?\n\n\nIf your GST turnover hits $75,000 or more, you’ve got 21 days to register. In some cases, you’ll need to register no matter what you earn, like if you’re driving for Uber or doing other ride-share gigs. Earning less? You can still register voluntarily if it makes sense for your business. Got questions? Reach out to us in the app chat. ANNA can help you get registered.\n\n\nWhat is a BAS?\n\n\nA Business Activity Statement (BAS) is your regular tax check-in with the ATO. It’s where you report and pay GST, PAYG withholding (tax on wages), PAYG instalments (prepaid tax), and other business taxes. Most small businesses lodge it quarterly. See a sample.\n\n\nWhat’s an IAS?\n\n\nAn Instalment Activity Statement (IAS) is like a mini BAS. It’s used to report and pay things like PAYG instalments or withholding tax. You’ll usually get one monthly from the ATO if you should lodge it. See a sample.\n\n\nSo, what’s the difference between BAS and IAS?\n\n\nBoth are ATO forms used to report and pay business taxes but they serve different setups:\n\nBAS is the full kit: GST, PAYG withholding, PAYG instalments, and more\nIAS is the smaller version: no GST, just PAYG obligations.\n\nExample Time:\nLet’s say your business is registered for GST and lodges BAS quarterly. You’ve also got employees, so you’re withholding PAYG tax from their wages. If your payroll hits a certain threshold, the ATO might ask you to report PAYG withholding monthly, even if everything else stays quarterly. In that case, you’ll lodge a quarterly BAS for GST and PAYG instalments, and a monthly IAS just to handle PAYG withholding for your team.\n\nStill Confused? Check out ‘Simpler BAS’\nIf your GST turnover is under $10 million, you only need to report 3 things under the “Simpler BAS” method:\n G1 – Total Sales\n 1A – GST on Sales\n 1B – GST on Purchases\n\n\nGreat, so when is BAS due?\n\n\nIf you're on quarterly BAS, your due dates are below:\n\nOn monthly BAS? Pop into the app chat and give us a wave, we'll help you out.\n\nBonus: Lodging online? You could get up to 2 extra weeks, except for Q2 (1 Oct to 31 Dec), as the due date of 28 Feb already includes a Christmas extension.\n\nNote: Due dates apply to both lodgement and payment. Stressed about remembering the dated? Your ANNA tax calendar has deadline reminders tailored just for you.\n\n\nQuick Tips:\n\n\n• Keep it Clean: No cents. No rounding up. Whole dollars only on IAS/BAS.\n\n• Nothing to Report? Just lodge a NIL IAS/BAS through ANNA.\n\n• Oops! Made a mistake? Fix it in your next BAS or lodge a revision. Use code 1A/1B to correct GST on sales/purchases.\n\n• PAYG Instalment got you panicking? Too high? Just vary it (code T9, reason code T4). Overpaid last time? Claim a credit on B5.\nHeads up: If your instalments are too low, the ATO may charge interest.\n\n• Stay on top of it: Keep solid records of sales and expenses. ANNA can help you by matching your transactions and keeping track of your uploaded evidence. You can also use ANNA to prepare your BAS.\n\n• Stash that GST cash: Set aside GST as you go, your future self will thank you.
